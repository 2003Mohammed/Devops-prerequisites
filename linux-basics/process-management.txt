# Process Management in Linux (DevOps Prerequisite)

A process is a running instance of a program. Managing processes is critical for troubleshooting, performance tuning, and production stability.

## Viewing Processes
- ps : shows processes for current shell
- ps -ef : shows all running processes
- top : real-time process monitoring
- htop : enhanced version of top (if installed)

## Process States
- Running
- Sleeping
- Stopped
- Zombie

## Killing Processes
- kill PID : sends SIGTERM
- kill -9 PID : force kill (SIGKILL)
- pkill nginx : kill by process name

## Background & Foreground Jobs
- command & : run in background
- jobs : list background jobs
- fg %1 : bring job to foreground
- bg %1 : resume job in background

## DevOps Use Case
Used when services hang, memory spikes occur, or applications crash in production.
