# File Permissions and Ownership

Linux uses permissions to control access to files and directories.

## Permission Types
- r : read
- w : write
- x : execute

## View Permissions
- ls -l

Example:
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group file.sh

## Change Permissions
- chmod 755 file.sh
- chmod +x script.sh

## Ownership
- chown user:group file.txt
- chown -R user:group directory/

## DevOps Use Case
Incorrect permissions are a common cause of application and deployment failures.
