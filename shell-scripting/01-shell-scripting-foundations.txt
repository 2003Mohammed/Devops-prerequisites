# Shell Scripting Foundations (DevOps Focus)

Shell scripting is used to automate Linux tasks, CI/CD pipelines, server provisioning,
log handling, and deployment workflows.

## What is a Shell Script?
A shell script is a file containing a sequence of Linux commands executed by a shell.

## Shebang
#!/bin/bash
Tells the OS which shell to use.

## Creating a Script
touch script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh

## Variables
name="devops"
count=5
echo $name
echo ${count}

## Quotes
"double quotes" → variables expand
'single quotes' → variables do NOT expand

## Command Substitution
date=$(date)
echo $date

## DevOps Use Case
Used to glue Linux, cloud, Docker, and CI/CD steps together.
